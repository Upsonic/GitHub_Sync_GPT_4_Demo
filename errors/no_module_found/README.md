<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'errors.no_module_found' seems to be a custom library used for handling errors related to missing modules in a program. The library contains an element 'my_function', which suggests that it is designed to manage specific tasks related to missing or undefined functions, in this case, 'my_sum'. The function 'my_function' is used to call 'my_sum' and then print a message "yeap", seemingly to check if the function 'my_sum' exists and runs successfully. If 'my_sum' is undefined or missing, an error would likely be raised, which could then be handled using this 'errors.no_module_found' library.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'errors.no_module_found' library appears to be a custom error handling module with defined functions for various error messages. In this context, 'my_function' seems to be one of the functions within this module. This function is used to execute another function - 'my_sum', and then provide a confirmation of its execution through a printed message. If 'my_sum' isn't found in the larger code body, the 'no_module_found' error would likely be triggered, notifying the user of the missing module. The primary purpose of this module is to handle errors pertaining to modules not found in the code and provide clear, specific feedback about which function is causing the problem.
