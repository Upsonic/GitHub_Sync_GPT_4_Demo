<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>'errors.no_module_found' is a hypothetical library that likely handles or reports errors that occur when a particular function or module is not found in the current scope. In this case, the library is used to report the issue with "my_function" which attempts to call 'my_sum()', a function not defined in the same scope. The element "my_function" within the library represents a function that can be executed. This library and its elements are useful in debugging by providing specific error codes and messages related to missing modules.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'errors.no_module_found' library appears to be a type of error handling mechanism in a codebase. It is used to log, identify, or handle specific errors or issues that arise when a module or function is not found in the expected location or scope during the execution of the code. In the given context, it specifies an issue where a function, 'my_function', tries to call another function, 'my_sum', which is not defined or cannot be located in the current scope of the code. The purpose of this library and its elements would be to enhance the robustness of the codebase, make it easier to debug, and provide meaningful error messages to the developers.
