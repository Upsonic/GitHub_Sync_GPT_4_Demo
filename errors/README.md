<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'errors' library seems to be a collection of error messages or codes that are related to specific issues or exceptions that could occur in a program or code. Each element within this library represents a specific error type, providing detailed information about what went wrong. For instance, 'errors.no_module_found.my_function' likely refers to an error occurring when the function 'my_function' fails to find a named module. This helps in debugging or error handling by allowing for specific responses to each type of error and aids in understanding why an error may have occurred.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'errors' library appears to be a custom library that handles error messages in a program, specifically those relating to functions and modules not being found. The elements within this library seem to provide detailed information about the error encountered, including the name of the function or module that couldn't be found, and the action that was attempted when the error occurred. In the provided example, 'errors.no_module_found.my_function' might be used to raise a specific error message when the function 'my_sum()' is not found within the same scope as 'my_function'. This could be helpful for debugging, allowing the developer to know exactly which part of the code is causing the issue.
