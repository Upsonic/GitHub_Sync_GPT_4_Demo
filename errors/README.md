<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'errors' library appears to be a custom module for handling and categorizing different types of errors in the code. One of the elements in this library "errors.no_module_found.my_function" seems to correspond to a specific error related to the function 'my_function'. The purpose of such libraries is usually to manage errors more efficiently and make them easier to debug, by assigning specific titles or categories to different types of errors. This allows developers to quickly pinpoint the nature and location of the error through these titles or categories, and hence resolve them more quickly and effectively.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'errors' library, as indicated by its name, most likely serves the purpose of handling and raising errors in the code. The specific element 'errors.no_module_found.my_function' seems to be an error message that is raised when 'my_function' attempts to call another function 'my_sum' which is not found. This could be an effective way of managing errors as it indicates clearly which function is causing the error and where the missing elements are.
