<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'automatic' library, as suggested by the two elements explained here, seems to be designed to provide utility functions to help users understand their current Python environment more easily. The specifically discussed functions, 'print_pandas_version' and 'print_pd_version', are designed to quickly fetch and display the version information of the 'pandas' module, a crucial tool for data operations in Python. This can be invaluable for debugging or ensuring compatibility, as different versions of the 'pandas' module may have different functionalities or requirements.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'automatic' library, as suggested by the referenced elements, appears to be a tool for checking and displaying information about the Python programming environment, specifically with regards to the pandas library. The functions in this library such as 'print_pandas_version' and 'print_pd_version' provide a fast and efficient way to display the version of the pandas module currently being used. This is useful for troubleshooting, debugging, verifying the correct setup of the development environment, or having a reference for pandas-related tasks.
