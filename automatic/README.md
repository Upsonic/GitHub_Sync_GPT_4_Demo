<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'automatic' library seems to contain utilities simplifying some aspects of Python programming. Specifically, the two functions available, 'print_pandas_version' and 'print_pd_version', are used to output information about the pandas module installed in the Python environment. This could be particularly useful for developers working in multiple environments or even novices troubleshooting installation issues. By providing a quick way to check the version and details of the pandas module, developers can ensure compatibility and correct functioning of their data-oriented Python programs.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'automatic' library, specifically the 'automatic.v1.print_pandas_version' and 'automatic.v1.print_pd_version' functions, is designed to assist users in quickly identifying the version of the 'pandas' module currently installed in their Python environment. This can be particularly helpful for troubleshooting purposes, checking compatibility issues, or simply for reference. The 'pandas' module is often used for data manipulation and analysis in Python. The 'print_pd_version' function also provides the entire representation of the 'pandas' module, offering more detailed information about the current pandas environment.
