```python
automatic_v1 = upsonic.load_module("automatic.v1")
```
<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'automatic.v1' library appears to contain Python functions that are used to display the versions of particular libraries being used in the current Python environment, specifically the pandas library. The 'print_pandas_version' function displays the complete details about the pandas library, such as its version and configuration details. On the other hand, 'print_pd_version' provides information about the 'pd' module, including a short description and its version number. These functions are useful for troubleshooting or ensuring compatibility in code, by allowing users to quickly and easily check the versions of these libraries.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'automatic.v1' library appears to be a utility library created to assist users with determining the version of certain Python libraries in their current environment, specifically 'pandas' and 'pd'. This could be useful in a variety of contexts, for instance troubleshooting issues related to specific versions of the library, ensuring compatibility between different pieces of code, or confirming that a library is installed and imported correctly. The library includes at least two functions, 'print_pandas_version' and 'print_pd_version', both of which print the version information of the respective Python libraries when called. This makes it easier for users to verify their Python environment's configuration.
