<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'automatic.v1' library appears to be a toolkit for working with and managing different versions of certain Python libraries, particularly the pandas library often used for data analysis. The elements of this library, such as the 'print_pandas_version' and 'print_pd_version' functions, allow users to quickly and conveniently check what version of a specific library is currently in use. This can be particularly useful for troubleshooting issues related to library versions or ensuring that the correct version is being used for a specific task or project.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'automatic.v1' library seems to contain functions that are used for printing the version details of certain Python libraries, specifically pandas. These functions, 'print_pandas_version' and 'print_pd_version', do not take any arguments. They print the description and version details of the respective modules. These functions can be particularly useful in troubleshooting or verifying the version of the pandas library in use, ensuring compatibility and smooth functioning of scripts coded with these libraries. This can be critical in data analysis activities which often rely on specific features available in certain versions of pandas library.
