<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'flask' library is a web framework in Python that allows developers to build web applications. It provides tools and functionalities to handle requests and responses, routing, template rendering, and more. In the provided script, a 'flask' application has been serialized into a binary string using the 'dill' module for serialization and deserialization of Python objects. Key elements of this flask application are the import name 'flask.app', the view_functions which define responses to specific routes, and the url_map with URL matching rules. The application then gets deserialized back to a Python 'Flask' instance using the 'dill.loads' function. This demonstrates the library's ability to allow developers to save and restore the state of a flask application for various purposes like testing or migration.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'flask' library is a web development framework in Python that helps create web applications. Its elements, such as `view_functions` and `url_map`, play a crucial role in defining routes and URL matching rules in a web application. The 'flask.app' script mentioned here uses the 'dill' library to serialize Flask applications into binary strings and deserialize them back into Python objects. This process allows for the efficient storage and retrieval of application configurations and states. This mechanism particularly aids in managing more complex applications that have various routes and intricate source files or templates organization.
