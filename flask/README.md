<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>Flask is a lightweight and extensible Python web framework. It provides the necessary tools and libraries that allow developers to create web applications. Its elements include routing - which binds URLs to Python functions, templates - which integrate Python with HTML for dynamic webpages, and cookies/session handling for user data among other features. Flask does not require specific tools or libraries, enabling developers to choose their own tools and technology, making it much more flexible.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'flask' library is a lightweight web application framework in Python. It's designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. It provides options for routing, template rendering, handling requests and responses, and communicating with databases. It is mainly used to develop web applications, such as websites and APIs. Elements within Flask, like app, route, request, etc., help in various parts of a web application's lifecycle, like setting up routes for webpages, handling incoming HTTP requests, and running the application on a server.
