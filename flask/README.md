<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'flark' library is a Python framework used to build web applications. It includes scripts that use the 'dill' package to recreate and deserialize a Flask web application from a serialized binary string. The app has several properties and functions relating to its configuration and URL routing rules. It also contains information for handling requests and errors, and details of extensions. However, there is a potential security risk when deserializing, as it could execute arbitrary code during the process, so it should only be used with trusted data.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'flask' library in Python is a micro web framework used to construct and manage a web server. Many of its elements, like '_static_folder' and '_static_url_path', are used to manage static files and URLs, while 'view_functions' are used to define how the server responds to specific requests. Additionally, it comprises functionalities for HTTP utilities, routing, and error handling. Serialization and deserialization are important aspects, which involve transforming Python objects to and from a format that can be easily stored or transmitted. However, care must be taken while deserializing due to potential security risks.
