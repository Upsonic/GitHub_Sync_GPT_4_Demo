<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'flask' library is a micro web framework written in Python that is used for building web servers and applications. It provides a simple way to map route URLs to Python functions, enabling developers to create dynamic websites or services. The elements within 'flask' include configurations and settings (like the name of the static folder, templates folder, root path) that define the behavior and properties of a web application. Other elements include routes, which direct the application's request-response flow, and error handlers, which define how the application responds to different error types.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'flask' library is a micro web framework written in Python that is used for building web servers and applications. The Framework includes various components such as a routing system to match URLs to Python functions, a template engine to generate dynamic HTML pages, and support for secure cookies and user sessions. The elements within the 'flask' library, such as the templates folder, static folder, and root path, relates to the configuration and setup of a Flask application. The library also allows for defining routes and error handlers. The main purpose is to transform the serialized string back into a Python object, which then forms the basis of a Flask application instance.
