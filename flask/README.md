<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'flask' library, a Python web framework, is used to build web applications. It provides flexible and scalable methods for developers to create and manage web apps with relative ease. The Flask app in question consists of two routes: a root route that displays a greeting message and a static route that serves static content like images and CSS. The app also includes configurations for secure session management, URL mapping, and static file serving. The 'flask' library also allows for error handling and the utilization of Flask CLI commands. In this context, the 'flask' library is used within a serialized version of the application, which aids in deployment and transfer of the application across different systems.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'flask' library in Python is primarily used to develop web applications. It comprises elements such as routes (like the root and static routes) which define how to respond to HTTP requests. It also includes configurations for session management, static file serving, and application routing. Additionally, it provides error handling and includes Flask CLI commands which help in managing the application. Further, Flask apps can be serialized and deserialized using additional libraries like Dill. This helps in deploying or transferring the applications from one system to another, making 'flask' a versatile tool for web development.
