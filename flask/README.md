<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>Flask is a lightweight and powerful web framework for Python. It's designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. It provides simplified elements for building robust web applications such as routing, template engine. The 'flask.app' element is used to start the application server and it is a central object where other parts of the web application are hooked in. Flask allows for flexibility and provides a minimalistic layer of tools for developing web applications but can be extended with other libraries to add additional functionalities.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It's named as "micro" because it does not require particular tools or libraries, but it can support them if they are installed. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.

The Flask App is a crucial element in Flask. It's an object which globally allows Flask to communicate with your application and manage it. Itâ€™s the heart of the operation that routes requests, handles templates, serves static files, and also assists with testing your application.

One more vital element is flask.app.Flask.run() which is a simple and quick way to run a local development server that can be reached from your browser at localhost.

Furthermore, Flask also allows for the usage of extension modules to add functionality to your application such as database connections, form validations, and more. Key extensions include Flask-SQLAlchemy and Flask-WTF.
