<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'flask' library is a lightweight web application framework in Python. It aids in developing web applications by providing tools, libraries, and mechanisms. The elements of the 'flask' library include app instantiation that initiates a new web app, route configurations to map URLs to Python functions, request functions to handle HTTP requests, error handlers to manage exceptions and errors, and system parameters to set up needed variables. In addition, it uses other libraries like 'collections', 'defaultdict', 'Flask templating', and 'werkzeug routing' to offer a range of functionalities in the web application. This code specifically deserializes serialized data back into a Flask app.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'flask' library in Python is a micro web framework used to develop web applications. In the given code, the library is used to deserialize complex application setups related to Flask, converting serialized Python byte streams back into a fully operational Flask application. The setup includes aspects such as route configurations, request functions, error handlers and more, using different libraries and modules for various functionalities. Thus, the primary aim of using the 'flask' library in this instance is to restore a Flask web app from a serialized state.
