<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'translate' library is a helpful tool designed to make language translation easier in code. The main element of this library is the Translator class, which lets you create a translator object specific to the languages you want to translate between. Each object has 'from_lang' and 'to_lang' parameters that define the source and the target languages of the translation. It also includes a 'translate' method, which is used for actual translation of the text. This library can, hence, facilitate effective and efficient translation between multiple languages in a code-friendly manner.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'translate' library is used primarily for language translation tasks. It contains elements such as the Translator class which enables language translation through the creation of Translator objects. These objects can translate text from one language to another by using the 'translate' method, which requires 'from_lang' and 'to_lang' parameters to specify the original and target languages respectively. In the given function 'turkish_to_english', for instance, the library is used to translate Turkish text into English.
