<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'datascience' library is a collection of python functions intended to facilitate the overall data science workflow. It includes functionalities for creating, loading and preprocessing data (like filling missing values, and one-hot encoding), as well as visualizing datasets by plotting histograms. It has features for defining, training, evaluating, and tuning machine learning models. For instance, it includes capabilities for a linear regression model as well as a K-nearest neighbors model equipped with a tuning process via grid search. In essence, this library offers robust tooling for machine learning-centric data manipulations and analysis.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'datascience' library appears to be a custom set of tools for data preprocessing, visualization, and model building in machine learning workflows. The 'create_data' function is used for generating a dummy dataset. The 'load_data' and 'fill_missing' functions are used for reading a csv file and handling missing data respectively. Data manipulation includes the 'one_hot_encode' function, which allows categorical data to be properly used in machine learning algorithms. The 'plot_hist' function visualizes the data distribution of a specific column from the dataset. Two model-specific functions 'train_model' and 'tune_knn_model' facilitate the training of a linear regression model and tuning of a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model. The 'evaluate_model' function is used to gauge the performance of these models. Thus, this library covers a range of actions in a typical end-to-end data science project, from data preparation to modeling and evaluation.
