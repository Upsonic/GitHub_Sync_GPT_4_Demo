<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The `datascience` library is a comprehensive toolkit designed to streamline common tasks in data analysis and machine learning. Its various functions facilitate key operations such as data preparation, model training, evaluation, and optimization. For example, it includes utilities for creating sample data files, handling missing values, one-hot encoding categorical variables, and visualizing data distributions. Additionally, it provides specialized functions for training and tuning machine learning models, like linear regression and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), as well as evaluating their performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error. Overall, the library aims to simplify and standardize the workflow for data scientists.


<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The `datascience.v1` library provides a comprehensive suite of tools for handling various tasks in the data science workflow. It includes functions for data creation (`create_data`), loading (`load_data`), and preprocessing (`fill_missing`, `one_hot_encode`). Additionally, it offers functionalities for model training (`train_model`, `tune_knn_model`), evaluation (`evaluate_model`), and visualization (`plot_hist`). The overarching aim of this library is to streamline and standardize common data science operations, making it easier for users to develop, train, evaluate, and visualize machine learning models efficiently.
