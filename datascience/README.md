<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'datascience' library is designed to streamline various data science tasks, providing a collection of functions to facilitate the workflow from data creation and preprocessing to model training and evaluation. Functions such as `create_data` and `load_data` help in generating and loading datasets, while `fill_missing` and `one_hot_encode` assist in data cleaning and transformation. For machine learning, it offers functions like `train_model`, `evaluate_model`, and `tune_knn_model` to train, assess, and optimize models. Additionally, visualization tools like `plot_hist` help in exploring data distributions. Overall, the library aims to simplify common data science processes, making it easier for practitioners to work efficiently with data.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'datascience' library is designed to facilitate common data science and machine learning tasks by providing a collection of functions that cover various stages of the data analysis pipeline. Its elements include functions for data creation (`create_data`), loading (`load_data`), preprocessing (`fill_missing`, `one_hot_encode`), visualization (`plot_hist`), machine learning model training (`train_model`), evaluation (`evaluate_model`), and hyperparameter tuning (`tune_knn_model`). Each function addresses a specific aspect of the workflow, making it easier for users to perform tasks such as handling missing data, one-hot encoding categorical variables, visualizing data distributions, training and evaluating models, and optimizing hyperparameters.
