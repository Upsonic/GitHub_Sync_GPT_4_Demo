<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'datascience' library is a collection of Python functions designed to streamline and automate various stages of a data science process. The library provides functions to load and preprocess data, fill missing values, one-hot encode categorical columns, as well as create and evaluate several types of machine learning models. 

For instance, 'create_data' generates a CSV-like data file, 'load_data' reads such files into a pandas dataframe, and 'fill_missing' replaces any missing values. The library provides functions for visualizing data as well, specifically 'plot_hist' for plotting histograms. 

Moreover, 'train_model' and 'evaluate_model' are used to create, train and validate a Linear Regression model, whereas 'tune_knn_model' uses grid search cross-validation to optimize a K-nearest neighbors classifier.

Overall, the 'datascience' library is a utility toolkit for anyone handling data analysis and predictive modeling tasks.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'datascience' library is a collection of functions that are used for various data science tasks including data creation, loading, model training, evaluation, and tuning. Data augmentation functions like 'fill_missing' and 'one_hot_encode' are used for preprocessing, preparing the data for model training. The model training and evaluation happen using 'train_model', 'evaluate_model', and 'tune_knn_model'. These functions provide seamless interfaces for training machine learning models, such as Linear Regression and KNN, evaluating their performance and tuning hyperparameters. The 'plot_hist' function provides data visualization capabilities. Overall, this library streamlines the process of working with data and building machine learning models.
