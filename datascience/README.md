<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'datascience' library is a useful toolkit for a variety of data science tasks, particularly for conducting analysis on structured datasets, such as those found in CSV files. Its functions facilitate different stages of the data science workflow including data loading, data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, model optimization and data visualization. 

The 'create_data' function generates a hardcoded dataset while 'load_data' allows importing data from external CSV files. Functions 'fill_missing' and 'one_hot_encode' deal with data cleaning and preparation by imputing missing values and applying encoding techniques on categorical data respectively. 

Model creation and evaluation are addressed by 'train_model' and 'evaluate_model' functions, with 'tune_knn_model' providing a specific implementation for optimizing K-Nearest-Neighbors (KNN) models. Finally, 'plot_hist' function allows data visualization via creation of histograms. 

These functionalities combined contribute to making the 'datascience' library a versatile tool for building, evaluating, and optimizing machine learning models.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'datascience' library, as its name suggests, is intended to be used for various data science tasks. This Python library contains a collection of function elements primarily designed for data processing, analysis, visualisation, and model training and evaluation. 

The library simplifies scripts with in-built functions like 'create_data', 'load_data', and 'fill_missing' which respectively allow creating a CSV-like data file, loading a CSV data file into memory as pandas DataFrame, and filling missing values in a dataset. 

Furthermore, the library offers 'one_hot_encode' for improving machine learning prediction through categorical variables conversion, and 'plot_hist' for visualizing data distribution via a histogram. 

Two important functionalities are given for machine learning models: 'train_model' allows the training of a Linear Regression model, and 'tune_knn_model' creates and tunes a KNN model using grid search for the optimum number of neighbors. 

Lastly, 'evaluate_model' is used for assessing the performance of a machine learning model. 

With these tools, ‘datascience’ library offers streamlined and efficient data parsing, analysis, visualization, and machine learning capabilities.
