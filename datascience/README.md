<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'datascience' library is a set of Python functions designed for performing various data science tasks and operations. The library aims to simplify these tasks by creating reusable functions. The function 'create_data' generates CSV files for easier data analysis. The 'evaluate_model' function measures the performance of a predictive model by calculating the Mean Squared Error. 'Fill_missing' is used to handle missing data by replacing it with a specified value. The 'load_data' function simplifies the task of loading data from CSV files. 'One_hot_encode' converts categorical data into a format that's more suitable for statistical analysis. The 'plot_hist' function allows for the creation and display of histograms from data. The 'train_model' function is used to train a Linear Regression model on a dataset. The 'tune_knn_model' function optimizes the parameters for a K-Nearest Neighbors classification model using grid search.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'datascience' library is a collection of Python functions designed to assist with fundamental tasks in data science workflows. Its elements include several functionalities such as creating and writing data into a file('create_data'), loading data from CSV files into DataFrames ('load_data'), treating missing data ('fill_missing'), converting categorical data into a numerical format that can be understood by statistical models ('one_hot_encode'), creating histograms for data visualisation ('plot_hist'), and training predictive models ('train_model', 'evaluate_model'). It also includes a function to tune K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification model('tune_knn_model') with the aim of achieving the most accurate predictions. Overall, the purpose of the 'datascience' library is to provide an efficient and reusable set of tools for common data preprocessing, visualisation, and modelling tasks.
