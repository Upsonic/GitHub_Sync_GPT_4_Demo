<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'datascience' library contains several Python functions primarily used for preparing, analyzing, and modeling data. It includes functions to create and load data from files, handle missing values, one-hot encode categorical variables, and evaluate, train, and tune machine learning models. The 'datascience' library can be used for a wide range of tasks typical in a data science workflow, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and training both regression and classification models on both raw and preprocessed datasets. Its development aims to provide useful tools for data manipulation, visualization, and predictive modeling in Python.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'datascience' library contains various functions that assist in different stages of data science and machine learning projects. These functions include data-related operations such as creation of specific data sets ('create_data'), handling missing data ('fill_missing'), loading data from csv files ('load_data'), and transforming categorical data into numerical format ('one_hot_encode'). It also offers capabilities to perform initial data analysis using histograms ('plot_hist'). 

In terms of model-related functions, it provides ways to train a linear regression model ('train_model') and evaluate the model using mean square error ('evaluate_model'). Furthermore, it provides a function to tune parameters of a K-nearest neighbors (KNN) model for optimal performance ('tune_knn_model').

In general, this library aims to simplify common data processing tasks and machine learning workflows, providing a collection of functions ready to be used efficiently.
