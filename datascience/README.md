<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'datascience' library is designed to facilitate various aspects of data analysis and machine learning workflows. It offers a collection of functions to ease the process of data creation, loading, preprocessing, and visualization, alongside functions for training and evaluating machine learning models. Specifically, it includes functions to generate sample CSV data, handle missing values, load datasets, perform one-hot encoding, visualize distributions with histograms, train linear regression models, evaluate model performance, and optimize k-Nearest Neighbors classifiers using grid search. Overall, the library aims to streamline and standardize common data science tasks.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'datascience' library offers a suite of functions designed to streamline the process of developing, training, and evaluating machine learning models and handling data. Its elements provide functionalities for creating sample datasets (`create_data`), loading data from CSV files (`load_data`), handling missing values (`fill_missing`), and transforming data using one-hot encoding (`one_hot_encode`). It also includes capabilities for visualizing data distributions (`plot_hist`), training linear regression models (`train_model`), evaluating model performance (`evaluate_model`), and optimizing k-Nearest Neighbors classifiers (`tune_knn_model`). This cohesive set of tools aims to simplify and support various stages of a typical data science workflow, from data preparation to model tuning.
