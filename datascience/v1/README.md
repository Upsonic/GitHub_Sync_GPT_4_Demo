<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The `datascience.v1` library is a collection of utility functions designed to facilitate various stages of the data science workflow. It provides tools for data preprocessing, such as loading data from CSV files (`load_data`), filling missing values (`fill_missing`), and one-hot encoding categorical variables (`one_hot_encode`). The library also includes functions for data analysis and visualization, such as creating histograms (`plot_hist`). Additionally, it offers functionalities for machine learning model development, including training linear regression models (`train_model`), evaluating model performance (`evaluate_model`), and tuning k-Nearest Neighbors classifiers (`tune_knn_model`). It even includes a function to generate sample demographic data in CSV format (`create_data`). Overall, the library aims to streamline data handling, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation processes.
