<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'datascience.v1' library is a collection of utility functions designed to streamline common tasks in data science workflows. These functions encompass data preparation, model training, and evaluation, as well as data visualization. Specifically, they include functionalities to create and load datasets, handle missing data, perform one-hot encoding, plot histograms, train machine learning models (such as linear regression and k-NN), and evaluate these models using metrics like Mean Squared Error and Grid Search for hyperparameter tuning. This library aims to provide a convenient, standardized toolkit for data scientists to enhance productivity and consistency in their projects.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The `datascience.v1` library is a collection of functions designed to facilitate various common tasks in data science workflows. These functions cover a wide range of operations, including data manipulation (`create_data`, `load_data`, `fill_missing`, `one_hot_encode`), data visualization (`plot_hist`), and machine learning processes like training (`train_model`), evaluation (`evaluate_model`), and optimization (`tune_knn_model`). Collectively, these tools aim to streamline the process of preparing data, building models, and assessing their performance, making it easier for data scientists to perform end-to-end data analysis and machine learning tasks.
