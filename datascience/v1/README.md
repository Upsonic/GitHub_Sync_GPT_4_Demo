<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'datascience.v1' library is a comprehensive set of tools designed to facilitate various stages of a typical data science or machine learning project in Python. It provides a set of pre-built functions to handle tasks such as data creation, loading, filling missing values, encoding categorical variables, as well as model training, tuning, and evaluate their performances. These functions work with common structures such as DataFrames and utilize many standard Python libraries, such as pandas and matplotlib. The aim is to automate repetitive tasks, reduce coding effort, and make the data processing and modeling workflow more efficient.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'datascience.v1' library is a collection of functions used for pre-processing, training, evaluating, and visualizing data in the context of data science and machine learning tasks. It includes utility functions for creating and loading data, filling missing values, one-hot encoding, and plotting histograms. Moreover, it provides functions for training models using Linear Regression, tuning k-nearest neighbors (KNN) model with grid search, and evaluating models by calculating the Mean Squared Error (MSE). This library seeks to simplify various stages in the machine learning pipeline and make the process more efficient.
