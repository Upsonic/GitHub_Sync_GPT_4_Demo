<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'datascience.v1' library appears to be a collection of user-defined functions aimed at performing various tasks in the data science pipeline, from data preparation and pre-processing to model training and evaluation. Specific utility functions include reading and creating data files, filling missing values, one-hot encoding, splitting data into training and testing sets, training linear regression models, and performing hyperparameter tuning for K-Nearest Neighbors models. The library also provides functionalities for creating histograms to graphically represent data distribution. The simplicity and straightforwardness of the functions make this library accessible and easy to use, thereby streamlining the workflow in any data science project.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'datascience.v1' library functions are designed to streamline the data science pipeline, offering functionalities for each step of the process from the data acquisition to the model evaluation. Functions like 'create_data' and 'load_data' let users generate and load datasets. Functions like 'fill_missing' and 'one_hot_encode' enable data preprocessing steps including dealing with missing values and encoding categorical variables. The 'train_model' function helps users train a Linear Regression model, while 'evaluate_model' and 'tune_knn_model' offer ways to assess and optimize model performance. Lastly, the 'plot_hist' function enables users to visually examine the distributions of their numeric variables.
