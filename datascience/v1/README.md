<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The `datascience.v1` library is a comprehensive toolkit designed for various stages of data science workflows, including data creation, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization. It provides functions to create sample datasets (`create_data`), handle missing values (`fill_missing`), load and transform data with one-hot encoding (`load_data`, `one_hot_encode`), and visualize data distributions (`plot_hist`). Additionally, it includes tools for training machine learning models, such as linear regression (`train_model`), and optimizing k-Nearest Neighbors classifiers through hyperparameter tuning (`tune_knn_model`). The library also features a function to evaluate regression models (`evaluate_model`) by calculating the Mean Squared Error on test datasets, facilitating a streamlined and efficient data science process.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The `datascience.v1` library is designed to streamline and facilitate various stages of a data science workflow. Its functions cover data preparation (e.g., `load_data`, `fill_missing`, `create_data`), data preprocessing (e.g., `one_hot_encode`), visualization (e.g., `plot_hist`), and machine learning model tasks including training, evaluation, and tuning (e.g., `train_model`, `evaluate_model`, `tune_knn_model`). The aim is to provide a set of tools that help data scientists handle common tasks more efficiently, from data acquisition and cleanup to model training and hyperparameter optimization.
