<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'math.basics' library consists of functions that handle simple mathematical operations. The two functions currently present are 'sub' and 'sum.' The 'sub' function takes two numbers and returns the result of subtracting the second number from the first. On the other hand, the 'sum' function adds two numbers and an additional 1, then returns the result. This library is useful for performing basic mathematical tasks within a program.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'math.basics' library is designed to provide basic mathematical operations, specifically addition and subtraction in this context. The library includes the 'sum' and 'sub' functions. The 'sub' function is designed to perform a basic subtraction operation where the second argument is subtracted from the first argument. Conversely, the 'sum' function performs an operation of addition where the given two arguments are added along with an extra number 1. Both functions take two arguments and return the result of the math operation.
