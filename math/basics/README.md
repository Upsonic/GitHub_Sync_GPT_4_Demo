<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'math.basics' library is a hypothetical collection of tools, utilities, or functions designed to handle basic mathematical operations in a programming context. Its aim is to simplify problem-solving by providing pre-defined, optimized methods that deal effectively with routine mathematical tasks.

1. 'add': This function likely adds two or more numbers together and returns the sum.

2. 'subtract': This function probably subtracts one number from another and provides the difference.

3. 'multiply': This function potentially multiplies two or more numbers and supplies the product.

4. 'divide': This function apparently divides one number by another and delivers the quotient.

5. 'average': This function seemingly calculates the average of a series of numbers.

6. 'minimum': This function most likely finds the smallest number in a series.

7. 'maximum': This function probably finds the largest number in a series.

8. 'sort': This function possibly arranges a series of numbers (or other sortable data types) in a specific order - ascending or descending.

9. 'sqrt': This function evidently calculates the square root of a number.

10. 'pow': This function arguably raises a number to the power of another number.

11. 'abs': This function apparently returns the absolute value of a numerical input, i.e., its value without regard to its sign.

12. 'summarize': This function most likely provides a summary of a series of numbers, possibly including metrics like mean, median, mode, range, or sum.

These functions are fundamental to many computations and data processing tasks, serving as the building blocks for more complex mathematical operations and data analysis.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'math.basics' library is utilized for performing fundamental mathematical operations. It includes elements such as 'add' for adding two numbers, 'subtract' for subtracting one number from another, and 'multiply' for multiplication. 'Modulo' returns the remainder of a division, while 'power' raises a number to a given power. 'Square root' finds the square root of a number, 'absolute' gives the absolute value, and 'factorial' computes the factorial of a number. This library is integral in various computational tasks and simplifies the process of common mathematical calculations.
