<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'math.basics' library appears to be a set of fundamental arithmetic functions that perform basic mathematical operations. Currently, it contains two functions: 'sub' and 'sum'. The 'sub' function performs subtraction between two numbers, taking the first one and subtracting the second from it. On the other hand, the 'sum' function performs the addition of two numbers. Both functions, essential for almost any mathematical operation or algorithm, are often utilized as building blocks for more complex mathematical, scientific, or data processing tasks.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'math.basics' library consists of two main functions designed to perform basic mathematical operations. These are the summation and subtraction functions. The 'sum' function, as the name suggests, takes two numbers as input and returns their sum. By contrast, the 'sub' function performs subtraction of two numbers, where the second number is subtracted from the first. These functions provide a simple, dedicated tool for these mathematical operations which can be essential in many computational programs or tasks.
