<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'math' library in Python is used for mathematical operations. It provides various functions to perform complex mathematical operations like square root, power, factorial, trigonometric functions, etc. The 'math.basics.sum' function, for instance, would be used to perform a summation operation. However, it is indicated that the cell for this particular function is empty, meaning there is no specific code in it to execute or that the function has not been defined yet. Overall, the 'math' library provides efficient and fast ways to perform mathematical functions in Python.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'math' library in Python includes various mathematical functions. These functions enable users to perform mathematical operations that go beyond the basic arithmetic functions provided by Python. The 'math.basics.sum' function, for example, allows users to calculate the sum of numerical values present in a list or other iterable structure. Users can use these functions to perform complex computations and solve mathematical problems easily and efficiently.
