<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'math' library, in this context, is a collection of mathematical functions aimed at performing basic arithmetic operations. The 'math.basics.sub' function serves to subtract one numerical value from another, while the 'math.basics.sum' function is designed to add two numerical values along with an extra value of 1. These functions are particularly useful for any computations involving addition or subtraction and simplify the process of performing these operations in your code by abstracting the built-in '+' and '-' operations.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'math' library encapsulates basic mathematical operations in its functions, providing a convenient platform to execute these operations. The 'sum' function adds two input numbers and 1 together, making it useful for mathematical calculations involving summation. The 'sub' function subtracts the second input number from the first, which could be beneficial for calculations involving subtraction. Together, these functions in the 'math' library simplify the process of performing basic arithmetic operations in programming tasks.
