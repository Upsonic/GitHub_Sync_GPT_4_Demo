<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'math' library in Python provides a variety of mathematical functions and operations that help programmers perform calculations. Its elements include diverse mathematical functions. For instance, trigonometric functions such as sin(), cos(), tan(), etc.; logarithmic functions like log(), log2(), log10(), exponential functions such as exp(); power and root functions like pow(), sqrt(); and several constants like pi and e. This library is extensively used in mathematical computations when performing tasks such as machine learning algorithms, statistical calculations, and more.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'math' library is used for mathematical computations in Python. It consists of various functions such as trigonometry, number conversion, algebraic functions, complex numbers, etc. This library provides functions for mathematical operations, enabling programmers to perform tasks like square roots, exponentiation, computing logarithms, and trigonometric operations. This built-in library helps to save time and effort to manually write these complex mathematical functions and calculations. The 'math' library is essential for tasks that involve mathematical computations.
