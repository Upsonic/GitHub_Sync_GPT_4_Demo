<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'math' library is a fundamental part of Python programming language that contains functions for complex mathematical computations and operations. The elements 'math.basics.sub' and 'math.basics.sum' are functions within this library that perform basic arithmetic operations. Specifically, the 'sub' function subtracts one number from another, and the 'sum' function adds two numbers together. These functions are useful for performing straightforward mathematical calculations in Python scripts or applications.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'math' library is a built-in module in Python that provides mathematical operations and functions. The aim of this library is to offer the user functionalities for various mathematical tasks like performing operations on numbers and solving complex equations. In the given context, the elements 'math.basics.sub' and 'math.basics.sum', are functions that perform mathematical operations. The 'sub' function performs subtraction and the 'sum' function carries out addition. These functions make it easier for users to perform common mathematical operations without having to implement these calculations from scratch.
