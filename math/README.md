<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'math' library in this context refers to a custom module that includes basic mathematical operations such as 'sub' for subtraction and 'sum' for addition. The 'math.basics.sub' code defines a subtraction function which accepts two arguments and subtracts the second one from the first. On the other hand, the 'math.basics.sum' function helps in performing the addition of two input values. These elements provide a simplified way to perform basic arithmetic operations in Python.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'math' library in this context is a user-defined library in Python that contains two main functions, 'sub' and 'sum'. The main purpose of this library is to perform basic arithmetic operations. The 'sum' function is used to add two numbers together, while the 'sub' function is used to subtract one number from another. It is useful in various computational tasks where basic arithmetic operations are required. The built-in '+' and '-' operators in Python are used in these functions to perform the operations. This mathematical library can be a building block foundation for more complex mathematical operations and computations.
