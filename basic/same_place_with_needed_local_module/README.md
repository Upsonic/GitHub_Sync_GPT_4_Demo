<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'basic.same_place_with_needed_local_module' library houses the 'my_function' routine, among potentially other elements not mentioned. The one function that is detailed, 'my_function', calls out to another function called 'my_sum', the workings of which are not detailed here but are part of this library. After executing 'my_sum', 'my_function' then proceeds to return a string message "Hello". This library is likely used to organize related functions, including 'my_function' and 'my_sum', and to modularize code for easier understanding, testing, and reusability. To fully understand the behavior of this library, especially the function 'my_sum', additional information is necessary.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'basic.same_place_with_needed_local_module' is a library that contains a functional element named 'my_function'. The main purpose of this library is to execute functions within the local module. In this case, 'my_function' is designed to execute another function called 'my_sum' and then return a string value "Hello". However, the precise action of 'my_sum' isn't specified here. The library aids in structuring code by allowing modular and sequential operations. To use it effectively, one would need to understand the functionality of both 'my_function' and 'my_sum'.
