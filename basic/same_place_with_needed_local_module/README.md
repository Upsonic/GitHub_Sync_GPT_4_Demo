<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>'basic.same_place_with_needed_local_module' is a library module that contains the 'my_function'. The purpose of this module is to provide functionalities related to the 'my_function' which doesn't take any arguments. When this function is executed, it calls another function named 'my_sum', then returns a string "Hello". However, the specific function of the 'my_sum' function is not detailed as its code is not provided. Thus, this module seems to be about encapsulating specific functionality involving these functions within a single library for the purpose of code organization and reuse.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'basic.same_place_with_needed_local_module' is a library that houses the 'my_function' function. Essentially, the primary aim of this library is to carry out the operations of the 'my_function' which interacts with another function 'my_sum'. The exact usage of the library and its elements may vary based on the specific implementation of 'my_sum' function. But, the predefined return of the 'my_function' indicates that it is mostly used for calling the 'my_sum' function and returning a string "Hello". It seems that this library plays a role of intermediary or a connector between various parts of a larger software system, ensuring that specific functions are enacted correctly and timely.
