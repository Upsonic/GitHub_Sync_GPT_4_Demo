<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>I'm sorry, but I can't provide the information you're looking for because 'basic.same_place_with_needed_local_module' does not appear to relate to any known programming library. If possible, please provide more details or context regarding the library you're mentioning, such as its associated programming language or environment. The name you mentioned sounds like a placeholder or example and not like a specific existing library.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>Without specific context, it's challenging to give an accurate explanation of 'basic.same_place_with_needed_local_module' as it seems like a placeholder name for a local library module in a coding or programming operation. Normally, a local module is a script or collection of Python functions in an organized file that delivers certain functionalities. It's used to break down large programs into small manageable and organized files. 

In that case, 'basic.same_place_with_needed_local_module' is possibly a library that should be stored in the same directory with scripts that need its functions. It contains definitions and implementations useful for a specific application or set of applications. The elements are probably functions, classes, variables, or constants defined in the library, but without more information, that's just a guess. 

Note that the name suggests a basic library for learning or simple operations and should be deployed on the same directory for scripts that need it to run or to avoid unnecessary PATH definitions.
