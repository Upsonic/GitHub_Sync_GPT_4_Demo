<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'basic.same_place_with_needed_local_module' is a library in Python that contains certain functions, including 'my_function'. 'my_function' executes another function named 'my_sum' before returning a greeting. The exact operation of the 'my_sum' function is not known without its context but it's clear that it performs an operation before the return statement in 'my_function'. The main purpose of this library appears to be to perform certain operations which are embodied in the functions it contains before returning specific outputs.
