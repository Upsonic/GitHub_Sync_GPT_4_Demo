<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'basic.same_place_with_needed_local_module' appears to be a library or module containing various elements, including the function 'my_function'. While the specific question doesn't go into detail about the overall purpose of this module, based on the 'my_function', it could be designed to work along with other local modules. It seems like this function may need to work with other parts of the same module - for example, it refers to a 'my_sum' function that's not defined in this part of the module. The library may include different functions that need to interact with each other, making these functions interdependent. However, for a complete understanding, more information or access to the full library and related functions would be needed.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'basic.same_place_with_needed_local_module' library appears to be a user-defined module aimed at organizing related functions for efficient management and reuse of code. The specific function mentioned, 'my_function', seems to act as a controller function that leverages another function 'my_sum'. Without knowing the functionality of 'my_sum', it's difficult to ascertain the exact purpose of the library. However, generally, such libraries aim at modularity and providing an organized structure for code and related functionalities.
