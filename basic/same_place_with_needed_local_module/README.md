<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>'basic.same_place_with_needed_local_module' is a library used in the context of a larger code base. Within this library, there exists a function called 'my_function'. The fundamental purpose of this library is to carry out certain functionality, specifically outlined in the 'my_function'. When 'my_function' is called, it activates another function called 'my_sum()', and then prints out the string 'Hello'. However, the 'my_sum()' function isn't defined within this library which indicates its definition is located elsewhere within the broader program. In other words, this library calls for operations defined in other parts of the program and then concludes by printing a greeting message. Its purpose and function thus depend largely on the context of the surrounding program.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'basic.same_place_with_needed_local_module' is a library that presumably contains a collection of modules, functions, and classes intended for executing specific tasks within a larger program context. A key element in this library is the 'my_function' function. This function holds a distinct role in the library - it serves as a mover for actions, running other functions, specifically a function called 'my_sum()', and printing a greeting. The specific 'my_sum()' function is not defined within 'my_function' implying that it is a part of the broader 'basic.same_place_with_needed_local_module' library or another module. The 'my_function' function is, therefore, a way of calling these other code elements when needed in the execution of a given program.
