<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'basic.same_place_with_needed_local_module' library appears to be a custom module where local functions and elements employed within the larger program or application are defined. It includes a function named 'my_function' that applies another function 'my_sum()' and then returns the string "Hello". The exact functionality and purpose of this library and its elements, particularly the 'my_sum()' function, cannot be drawn conclusively without further context. Nonetheless, it's evident this library serves as a repository housing internally-used, interlinked functions.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>'basic.same_place_with_needed_local_module' library is assumed to be a Python module based on its elements. Its main element appears to be the function 'my_function'. The primary usage of this function appears to be executing the another function, 'my_sum()', and then returning a simple string message saying "Hello." However, because the operation of 'my_sum()' is unknown without additional context, it is difficult to ascertain the precise purpose of this library. This library might be a part of a larger codebase where 'my_function' plays a role in running a specific operation using 'my_sum()' function and then indicating its completion by returning "Hello". Furthermore, the exact aim or functionalities of the library are unclear due to limited information.
