<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'basic.same_place_with_needed_local_module' library appears to be a custom library that contains defined functions intended for use in a larger application. One of the functions in this library is 'my_function', which does not take any arguments and is designed to call another function, 'my_sum()', and then return a "Hello" string. However, the 'my_sum()' function is not defined within provided information about the library, so its purpose is unclear. It suggests that this library likely has dependencies on other local modules where 'my_sum()' might be defined. The library will be used in the same place where these local modules are needed. Without additional information about the library and the other functions it contains, it's hard to determine its overall purpose.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'basic.same_place_with_needed_local_module' library seems to be a collection of Python functions and objects which include the 'my_function'. The intent of this library and its elements seems to accomplish tasks or operations related to a specific project or program in Python, possibly related to maths, given the 'my_sum()' function. However, without more specific details or more functions in the library it is difficult to ascertain the exact usage aim of 'basic.same_place_with_needed_local_module'. As it stands, 'my_function' is meant to execute the 'my_sum()' function and return a greeting message.
