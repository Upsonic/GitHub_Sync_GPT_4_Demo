<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'basic.same_place_with_needed_local_module' library appears to be a locally created module that holds certain functions like 'my_function'. Such a structure usually indicates that the module and its functions are used in a specific project or use-case, part of which was shared in the question - 'my_function'. This function seems to call another function 'my_sum' from the same or another local module for some computational operation. Unfortunately, without the definition of my_sum or more information, the exact purpose cannot be determined. It is likely that this module is used to compartmentalize code and improve code organization for easier maintenance and understanding.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'basic.same_place_with_needed_local_module' library appears to be a custom Python module designed to contain distinct and defined functionalities in its elements, in this case a function, which are needed within the project's local environment. The function 'my_function' within it performs certain operations based on another function 'my_sum'. However, it's challenging to define the exact use or purpose of this module without more data about the 'my_sum' operation. This module might be part of a larger Python codebase where 'my_sum' is defined and successfully imported enables users to streamline the design and implementation of the code with compartmentalized functionalities. Overall, the library and its components seem to contribute to the modularity and thereby efficiency of the project.
