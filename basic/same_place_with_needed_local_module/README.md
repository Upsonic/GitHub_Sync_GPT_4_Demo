<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>'basic.same_place_with_needed_local_module' is a library module in the codebase. While the provided information does not specify all functionalities within this module, we know that it contains a function named 'my_function'. This function, 'my_function', invokes another function named 'my_sum' (presumably defined elsewhere in the module or in a different part of the application), and then returns a greeting string, indicating that at least part of this module is used to invoke certain processes and then respond to the calling program with a message. Details of what other functions, variables, or classes present in this 'basic.same_place_with_needed_local_module' are not provided. It is essential that this module coexists in the same environment as the 'my_sum' function for the proper execution of 'my_function'.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>'basic.same_place_with_needed_local_module' is a library that appears to contain organized code required for specific functionality within a larger program. One of its elements includes a function named 'my_function'. This function, when called, internally calls another function named 'my_sum' before returning the string "Hello". The actual functionality of 'my_sum' is not specified but it seems integral to the operation of 'my_function'. Therefore, this library seems to be aimed at providing the 'my_function' utility that involves the 'my_sum' operation and returns a greeting message.
