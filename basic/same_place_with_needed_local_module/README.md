<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'basic.same_place_with_needed_local_module' library appears to be a custom Python library or module developed for the context of its parent application. The purpose of this library is not provided in the given information, but it appears to house various elements (like functions) that perform specific tasks for the parent application. One such element is the 'my_function,' which, whilst simplistic, seems to be a function that executes another function ('my_sum') and returns the string "Hello". The overall operation and purpose of the library, as well as the 'my_sum' function, would depend on their implementations which aren't provided.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'basic.same_place_with_needed_local_module' library appears to be a custom module that contains a function 'my_function'. This module may be part of a larger codebase and is used to separate functionalities for better organization and ease of use. The module itself or 'my_function' within it might be used in various parts of the program to run specific operations (implemented in 'my_sum') and return "Hello." Without more information about 'my_sum' and its implementation, it's difficult to explain the module's complete purpose. However, in general, this kind of module usage improves maintainability and readability of the code by segregating functionalities.
