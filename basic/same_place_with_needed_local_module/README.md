<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'basic.same_place_with_needed_local_module' is a library which encapsulates functionalities that are used in your programs. The key element in this library is the function 'my_function'. This function's purpose is to call the 'my_sum' function which may or may not perform some operations, and eventually return a string "Hello". Without further details about 'my_sum' function, it is uncertain what specific operations this function is performing. However, it is evident that regardless of the outcome or results of the 'my_sum' function, 'my_function' will always return the string "Hello".

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'basic.same_place_with_needed_local_module' library contains functions that aim to perform certain tasks and return specific outputs. One of the functions in this library called 'my_function' is designed to call another function named 'my_sum' and then return a string "Hello". However, it is unclear what the function my_sum does, as it does not store or use the result anywhere. The purpose of this library seems to be to execute certain functions, evaluate them and then return a specified output. Though the specific workings of the library is unclear without detailed knowledge about every function in the library, 'my_function' is expected to always return a greeting, irrespective of the result of the 'my_sum' function.
