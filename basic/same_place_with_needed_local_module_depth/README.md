<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>'basic.same_place_with_needed_local_module_depth' is a library that appears to be a part of a hierarchical Python module system. One of its elements is 'my_function', which executes a sequential operation by calling an external function 'my_sum', followed by returning a string "Hello". The library might contain other functions or classes designed to execute operations or processes. The purpose of this library might rest on the requirements of the 'my_sum' function and how 'my_function' interacts with it. This suggests that the library is part of a larger system designed to manipulate and process data.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'basic.same_place_with_needed_local_module_depth' library seems to be a structural setup for coding where different modules and functions are structured hierarchically. The main aim is to streamline the coding process and make the management of code easier.

The elements in this library like 'my_function' serve specific roles within this structure. In the provided example, 'my_function' is used to ensure that another function 'my_sum' is executed, and irrespective of its outcome, a particular output ("Hello") is returned. This can be really useful in cases where we want to separate the execution and output processes, or where we want to ensure that certain procedures are followed regardless of the results of previous operations.

However, it's important to note that the description doesn't clarify what 'my_sum' function does or where it is defined. The effectiveness and functionality of 'my_function' hence heavily depend on the 'my_sum' function.
