<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'basic.same_place_with_needed_local_module_depth' library appears to be a module designed for organizing code with a specific structure and depth. Its elements, such as 'my_function', are likely intended to demonstrate or implement certain functionalities, potentially as part of a larger educational example or utility library. 'my_function', for instance, showcases a basic function structure that relies on another function ('my_sum') to perform an intermediate operation before returning a final result. The example indicates the importance of having all necessary functions defined within the correct scope for the code to operate properly.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'basic.same_place_with_needed_local_module_depth' library likely encapsulates a set of functionalities designed to be used within the same module or local workspace. One of its elements, `my_function`, demonstrates the usage of a locally defined function within the same module by calling another function (`my_sum`) and returning a greeting. The primary aim seems to be to ensure that functions can operate cohesively in a confined scope, enabling modular design and encapsulation, while relying on dependent functions being correctly defined within the same local context.
