<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'basic.same_place' library is a collection of functions or routines which are related or belong to similar categories. They are stored in the same place (or the same library), hence the name. A primary function in this library, 'my_function', exemplifies its basic operations. 'my_function' is designed to take no input arguments and simply returns a pre-set message, in this case, a simple greeting of "Hello". The purpose of this library is to provide a set of basic, easy-to-use functions for users without complex operations or extensive codes. This straightforward approach is characterized by the 'my_function', emphasizing simplicity and user-friendliness.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'basic.same_place' library presumably contains simple, straightforward functions like 'my_function' which perform basic operations. The idea is to have a collection of code snippets that can be reused in different programs. The 'my_function' function, specifically, is designed to return a greeting message. This could be used in a variety of applications where a simple greeting message is needed. This suggests the library's primary purpose is to facilitate routine programming tasks by providing pre-made functions.
