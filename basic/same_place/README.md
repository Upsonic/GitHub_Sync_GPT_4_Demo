```
<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>'basic.same_place' is a library that contains one function named 'my_function'. The sole purpose of this function, as defined in this library, is to return a predefined string "Hello" and it does not require any arguments to do so. The simplicity of this library suggests it might be used for beginner-level coding lessons or debugging purposes, or as a placeholder in a larger coding project.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'basic.same_place' library seems to be used for basic functions that are universal and might be needed in various parts of a code. It offers simple functions, such as 'my_function' which does not require any arguments or special operators and only returns a hardcoded string "Hello". This would be useful for instances where a simple welcoming message or acknowledgement is needed. The purpose of such a library appears to offer basic functions that can be called upon when needed, simplifying the coding process and potentially saving time in coding.
