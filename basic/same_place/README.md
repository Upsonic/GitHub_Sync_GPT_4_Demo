<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'basic.same_place' appears to be a Python module or library featuring the function 'my_function'. Its purpose will depend on the specific programming environment. If 'my_function' is the only function in this module, then 'basic.same_place' exists to provide a way to print the greeting "Hello" to the standard output. This could form part of a larger system or could be an educational script helping new coders to learn how to define and call functions in Python. The library, as indicated by the provided information, uses the built-in Python 'print()' function to accomplish its tasks.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'basic.same_place' library is a custom library possibly designed for rudimentary applications in Python programming. From the given example, it seems this library contains at least one element, 'my_function', with a purpose to perform a basic printing operation in the console. The use of this function is to output a pre-determined message ("Hello") whenever it is called. The library, thus, seems to aim at providing simple and direct functionalities, potentially for learning purposes or to complement larger codes with its straightforward features.
