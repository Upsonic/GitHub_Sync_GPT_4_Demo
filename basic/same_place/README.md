<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>'basic.same_place' is a library that contains functions, such as 'my_function'. This particular function doesn't take any arguments and returns a preset message "Hello" when called. The purpose of this library is to provide functions that perform simple tasks, such as returning a preset message. Other elements within the library likely serve similar simple, predefined tasks that can be called upon as needed.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'basic.same_place' library is primarily used for storing functions that return preset messages. The functions in this library, such as 'my_function', are designed to return specific strings when they are called, providing users with predefined messages. These functions do not accept any arguments, nor do they carry out any operations other than returning their specified string. This library is useful in situations where a certain message has to be displayed multiple times, eliminating the need to type the message repeatedly as it can simply be called from the function.
