<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>'basic.same_place' appears to be a library containing elements, one of which is a function named 'my_function'. The purpose of this library may be to store basic, consistent functions that can be used within code without needing to be redefined each time. The function 'my_function' specifically contained in this library simply returns the string "Hello" when invoked, performing a simple operation that does not depend on any external conditions or variables. This library might be used for debugging or testing, teaching basic programming principles, or for other functions that require simple, non-variable outputs.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'basic.same_place' library seems to be a minimalistic module that includes straightforward functions, such as 'my_function'. The main purpose of this library appears to be to provide simplistic functional tools with clearly defined outputs, which can be useful in learning to code, in early development stages of a project, or in scenarios where complex operations are not required. The 'my_function' in particular, which always returns the string "Hello," could be used to check the functionality of systems, for debugging processes, or simply for demonstrating the basics of function definition and calling.
