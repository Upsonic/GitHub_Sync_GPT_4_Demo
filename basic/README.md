<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'basic' library is a simple collection of functions, all named 'my_function', used primarily to return the string 'Hello'. The library's functions vary with respect to their dependencies and location within the code. Some versions of the function make a call to another function named 'my_sum', although this does not affect the output of 'my_function'. The purpose of those versions of 'my_function' can only be fully understood if we know the definition and implementation of 'my_sum'. The purpose of the 'basic' library seems to be offering different versions of the same base function to suit different needs or contexts.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'basic' library consists of multiple functions, each introduced with an aim to return a static string "Hello". The 'basic.different_place.my_function' and 'basic.same_place.my_function' functions are simplistic and return this static string without any operations or logic involved. 

The 'basic.same_place_with_needed_local_module.my_function' and 'basic.same_place_with_needed_local_module_depth.my_function' are a bit more complex, as they call another function 'my_sum' before returning the "Hello" string. However, since the 'my_sum' function is not defined within this library, we cannot fully understand its operation. It's important to note that the operation or the result of 'my_sum' does not influence the output "Hello" of these two functions. The purpose of implementing 'my_sum' call before returning string might be due to some additional operations required in the broader program context.

Overall, the main purpose of the 'basic' library is to provide functions that can give a static output "Hello" while potentially performing other, undefined operations.
