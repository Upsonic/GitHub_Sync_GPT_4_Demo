<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'basic' library presents a collection of fundamental functions designed for specific operations in a codebase. The 'basic.same_place.my_function' in this library defines a function that returns a static message i.e., "Hello". This function doesn't perform calculations but just returns a predefined string. On the other hand, the 'basic.same_place_with_needed_local_module_depth.my_function' function tries to execute another function 'my_sum', and should an error occur during the execution, it gracefully handles it and returns an "Error" message. Hence, these functions together serve the purpose of providing a simple message return, and error handling during function execution.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'basic' library is used to define fundamental functions or methods for fundamental programming operations. The aim is to provide simple and concise functionalities such as displaying static messages or handling errors. The 'basic' library contains elements like 'same_place.my_function' which outputs a static message whenever it is invoked. It also includes 'same_place_with_needed_local_module_depth.my_function', a method that attempts to perform a specific operation and provides a useful error message if there are any issues. It ensures the program can handle potential issues and doesn't crash unexpectedly.
