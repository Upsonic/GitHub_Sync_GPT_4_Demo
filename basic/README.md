<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The provided information does not give a specific description of the 'basic' library in Python. The mention of 'basic.same_place_with_needed_local_module.my_function - function' suggests that 'basic' might be a custom Python library, made to organize code in a more structured way. The 'same_place_with_needed_local_module' might be a module inside the library and 'my_function' the function inside this local module. However, without more concrete descriptions or information about the functionality of this library, it's unsure what 'basic' library specifically does.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>I'm sorry, but your request can't be completed as it stands. The information given about the 'basic' library is not sufficient. In Python, there isn't a built-in or standard library known as 'basic'. Could you please specify the exact library you're referring to? Also, the function 'my_function' and its usage or purpose is not clear from the given details. Therefore, providing an explanation about the usage or aim of this library and its elements is currently impossible. Please provide more context or details.
