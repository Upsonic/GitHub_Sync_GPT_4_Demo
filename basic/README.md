<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'basic' library appears to be a collection of simple functions, primarily designed to output various versions of a greeting, "Hello". It includes different variants located in distinct places, hence the 'different place' and 'same place' tags. One function, basic.different_place.my_function, is straightforward and returns a greeting. The other, basic.different_place_with_needed_local_module.my_function, first invokes another function called 'my_sum' before returning the greeting. The purpose and workings of 'my_sum' are not known. In the 'same_place' category, the function behaves similarly to basic.different_place.my_function, returning the same greeting without any computations.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'basic' library discussed here appears to be mainly used for storing various versions of a function named 'my_function'. The purpose of 'my_function' across the library generally revolves around outputting a simple greeting - "Hello". In 'basic.different_place.my_function', it does just that - returns the greeting without any arguments or additional operations. However, in 'basic.different_place_with_needed_local_module.my_function', it first calls another function named 'my_sum' before returning the greeting, the functionality of 'my_sum' is however unknown. Lastly, in 'basic.same_place.my_function', it reverts back to its simplest form, returning the greeting with no argument requirements or additional operations.
