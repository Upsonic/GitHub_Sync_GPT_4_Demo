<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'basic' library is a collection of functions specifically created to return greeting messages. The library remains the same regardless of its location, providing consistent functionality across different places ('basic.different_place.my_function') or within the same place ('basic.same_place.my_function'). Both functions within the 'basic' library are simple, using no parameters or performing any data manipulation or computations, and are designed solely to return the greeting "Hello".

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'basic' library serves primarily to provide simple functions that return greeting messages. It includes elements such as 'basic.different_place.my_function' and 'basic.same_place.my_function', both of which are functions designed to return a fixed greeting message, "Hello". Although the two functions are placed differently, they share the same purpose and operation. They do not take any arguments or perform any calculations, making them straightforward and easy to use for greeting message generation.
