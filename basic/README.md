<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'basic' library in Python consists of straightforward, essential functions that perform simple tasks. It contains 'my_function' located in different modules, but both do the same thing. They are designed for the purpose of printing a greeting message "Hello" to the console. These functions do not take any input arguments and all they do is utilize Python's built-in 'print' function whenever they're called.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'basic' library seems to be a custom library developed for Python programming, and it contains various elements or functions having a similar task. The basic purpose of these elements is to print a simple greeting message "Hello" on the console. This is performed either with 'my_function' stored in a 'different_place' or 'same_place' in the 'basic' library. It demonstrates the usage of Python's built-in 'print' function, and its ability to define and use custom functions for specific tasks such as displaying a simple greeting. This kind of libraries can be useful for beginners to understand fundamental concepts like function declaration, function calling, and basic input-output operations in Python.
