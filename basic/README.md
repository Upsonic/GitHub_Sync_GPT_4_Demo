<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'basic' library is a collection of pre-defined functions designed to return the string "Hello". These functions, all named 'my_function', either simply return the greeting or are designed to first call another function 'my_sum()'. It seems that the purpose of 'my_sum()' within the 'my_function' varies between making calculations, making changes to some global variables, or other unknown actions. The exact purpose of 'my_sum()' is unclear from the available summaries, indicating it might be defined elsewhere in the programs. The use of 'my_sum()' in the second and fourth 'my_function' actually does not impact the final output of "Hello", though in the absence of 'my_sum()' the fourth function would result in an error. Summarising, the 'basic' library contains variations of a function producing a standard greeting, with some versions incorporating an additional unspecified function 'my_sum()'.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'basic' library seems to be a collection of functions aimed at greeting operations or returning a specific string "Hello". Each function is defined under different directories or modules within the 'basic' library, providing variations on how the greeting function can be implemented. They seem to illustrate different scenarios, some of which involve the usage of additional, undefined functions such as 'my_sum()', possibly to showcase how local modules might integrate with these functions.
