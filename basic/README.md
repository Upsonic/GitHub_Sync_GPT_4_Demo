<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'basic' library here represents different modules with various versions of a function called 'my_function'. The primary purpose of these functions, regardless of their place, functionality, or interaction with other modules, is to return a string 'Hello'. Some versions simply return 'Hello', while others call another function, 'my_sum', beforehand - though the function 'my_sum' doesn't seem to affect the output. As 'my_sum' isn't defined in the given code, we can't identify its role or influence. The library presents different 'my_function' scenarios but ultimately all return the same outcome, the string 'Hello'.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'basic' library appears to be a collection of simple Python functions, all named 'my_function', each demonstrating different scenarios. They all return a static string "Hello". The function does not take any arguments and can be called from different places within the code base. Some versions of 'my_function' include a call to another function called 'my_sum', but without definitions for this function, it is unclear what its purpose and behavior are. The main aim of this library seems to be to provide examples or templates for defining and invoking functions in Python, with a variation in local module dependency.
