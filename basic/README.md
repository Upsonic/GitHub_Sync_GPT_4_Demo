<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'basic' library contains functions that are primarily purposed to return the string "Hello" upon being called. These functions do not take any input arguments. They differ in how they achieve this similar result and where they are defined within the program. Some of the functions in the library call another function named 'my_sum' which is defined elsewhere, indicating that the 'basic' library is dependent on other parts of the program for some of its operations. These 'my_sum' calls complicate the precise functionality of these functions since the 'my_sum' function is not defined here. Overall, the 'basic' library provides a method to output predefined strings, in this case, "Hello", either directly or after calling other functions.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'basic' library is a collection of functions designed to return the string "Hello". It contains a variety of functions, each performing this task in different contexts. The 'my_function' in 'basic.different_place' returns the "Hello" string directly, while its counterpart in 'basic.different_place_with_needed_local_module' executes another function 'my_sum()' before returning the same string. On the other hand, 'basic.same_place' and 'basic.same_place_with_needed_local_module' also contain their versions of 'my_function', both of which follow similar logic to their 'different_place' counterparts. Overall, the purpose of these functions seems to be the execution of certain predefined tasks, followed by returning a specific string message.
