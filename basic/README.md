<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'basic' library contains elements that are essential for certain basic programming functions, primarily related to outputting strings. One element in the 'basic' library, 'different_place.my_function', defines a specific function that returns a string "Hello" whenever it's called, without requiring any input arguments. The other element, 'same_place.my_function', serves a similar purpose in that it also provides a pre-established output ("Hello") upon being called, without needing any input argument. Both of these elements serve to simplify and streamline string output processes for programmers, easing their tasks and contributing to more efficient code.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'basic' library contains simple, predefined functions that serve to output particular messages. It includes elements such as 'different_place.my_function' and 'same_place.my_function'. Both functions take no arguments and return the string "Hello". These functions can be used to simplify the coding process when a predetermined response is needed, in this case, the string "Hello". Their purpose is to provide quick, straightforward ways to generate designated outputs upon their call, without further operations or alterations.
