```
<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'basic' library consists of a set of predefined functions primarily named 'my_function'. The purpose of these functions seems to revolve around carrying out a certain operation, defined in another function called 'my_sum(), and then returning a greeting string "Hello". However, the exact operation performed by 'my_sum()' is not disclosed in the provided code samples. Some elements of the library indicate that 'my_sum()' might be defined in the same module, while others suggest it's coming from a different module or place. Without understanding what 'my_sum()' exactly does, it's hard to fully grasp the overall purpose of the 'basic' library and its elements. The constant across all the 'my_function' instances, however, is the eventual return of the string "Hello".

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'basic' library and its elements appear to be functioning as simple practice codes, or placeholders for more complex functions that are yet to be defined. The elements of this library are different iterations of 'my_function' function, all essentially returning a greeting text "Hello". However, in some versions of 'my_function', there is an arbitrary call to another function 'my_sum' before the greeting text is returned. The 'my_sum' function is not defined in the provided context, hence its actual purpose cannot be determined and it's presumed to be a placeholder. The overall aim may be to establish a structure for more detailed programming operations in the future, introducing concepts like functional calls from the same place, different place, and a required module, etc. This library is likely used for teaching or demonstrating these basic programming concepts.
