<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'basic' library is a collection of functions, all named 'my_function', defined in different modules. The primary purpose of each of these functions is to return the string "Hello" when called, with no external inputs or arguments required. They primarily differ in their side-effects - while some (found in 'different_place' and 'same_place' modules) are standalone and don't interact with any other functions, others (in 'same_place_with_needed_local_module' and 'same_place_with_needed_local_module_depth' modules) call an additional function, 'my_sum', before returning the "Hello" string. However, the purpose and effect of this 'my_sum' function are not given, and it doesn't impact the final output of 'my_function'. Overall, the 'basic' library is a set of simplistic functions mainly used for outputting a static string.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'basic' library is designed for simple operations, particularly focused on functions that return a simple string "Hello", regardless of any other logic or operations they might contain. It contains 4 main elements, all named 'my_function' but defined in different contexts. The first two functions, in the 'different_place' and 'same_place' respectively, do not involve any other operations and are primarily used to return a greeting. The other two functions involve an additional operation involving a function named 'my_sum', however, they don't utilize the result of this function and their purpose remains to return the static string "Hello". Without knowledge of what 'my_sum' does, these functions' secondary purpose is to execute 'my_sum' visibly for side effects rather than for its resulting value. However, all these functions are hard-coded to always return "Hello", serving as simple greeting functions.
