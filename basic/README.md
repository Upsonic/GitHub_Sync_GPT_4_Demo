<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'basic' library consists of elements like 'my_function' that perform certain operations. In the context provided, it seems to be a custom library used for defining fundamental functions in Python. The first element, 'basic.same_place.my_function', simply returns the string 'Hello' when called. It does not perform any specific operations and does not accept any input argument. The second element, 'basic.same_place_with_needed_local_module.my_function', when invoked, calls another function 'my_sum', before returning the string 'Hello'. The specific operations performed by this local module 'my_sum' are not clear without its implementation but it appears to be related to some computation or operations. The 'basic' library, therefore, serves as a container for simple and possibly more complex functions that return a greeting after performing certain operations.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'basic' library seems to be focused on providing basic functional operations that return the string "Hello". It includes elements like the 'same_place' and 'same_place_with_needed_local_module', both of the modules having a function called 'my_function'. 

The aim of the 'my_function' within 'same_place' module is straight forward, that is, to simply return the greeting "Hello". However, the 'my_function' within 'same_place_with_needed_local_module' seems to operate differently. It is designed to call another function 'my_sum' before returning the greeting. The purpose of 'my_sum' function is unknown but it's safe to say that it performs some kind of operations or calculations. 

This functionality implies that this 'basic' library can be used when you need a function that either greets the user or performs some operations before greeting.
