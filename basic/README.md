<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'basic' library appears to be a Python library which provides a foundation for various tasks with the help of its in-built functions. The 'different_place' and 'same_place' seem to be modules or subsets within the 'basic' library with their 'my_function'. The function within 'same_place' does not perform any computational operations. Instead, it returns a string "Hello". However, there is no information provided about the functionality of 'my_function' in the 'different_place' module.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'basic' library, as per the given data, seems to be a rudimentary Python library with elementary functions. Each element of this library, in particular, 'my_function', serves specific yet simple purposes. The 'basic.different_place.my_function' function currently does not have any operational code, suggesting that it is either a placeholder or a function yet to be fleshed out. On the contrary, 'basic.same_place.my_function' is a non-parametric function designed to always return the string "Hello" each time it is invoked. This characteristic may particularly be useful in instances whereby a simple greeting is continuously required or for testing purposes in a broader software package.
