<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'basic' library encompasses functions that perform simple operations, often involving the execution of a secondary function 'my_sum', and then returning a string value "Hello". The specific use of 'my_sum' varies, and the explicit purpose of these functions cannot be fully determined without understanding what 'my_sum' does. 

Some elements in the 'basic' library call 'my_sum' from a different place or require a local module, adding a level of complexity to their overall functionality. In contrast, some elements just return a hardcoded string without any computation. Hence, the library seems to interact with other parts of the code or modules, and also provide simple string return functionalities.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'basic' library seems to be a collection of functions for various purposes. The main recurring theme is the definition of a function named 'my_function' which always returns the string "Hello". In some instances, this function also calls another function named 'my_sum'. The purpose and functionality of 'my_sum' are not clear as it's often mentioned to be defined elsewhere. However, it's implied that 'my_sum' performs some kind of operation or computation, the result of which might affect the behavior of 'my_function'. Without more context, it's tough to determine the overall behavior and utility of these components within the 'basic' library.
