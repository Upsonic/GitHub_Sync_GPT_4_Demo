<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'basic' library seems to consist of various elements or functions, all named 'my_function'. These functions, located either in the same or different places as the 'basic' library, primarily execute another function named 'my_sum' (which is defined elsewhere), and return a string "Hello". Although the specifics of what 'my_sum' does are not detailed, these 'my_function' elements are structured to trigger my_sum's operations and deliver a greeting message. Some functions within the 'basic' library also require a local module for functioning correctly. The exact role of this local module is not stated, adding to the overall ambiguity of the library's purpose.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'basic' library comprises of different functions to create or perform different tasks. Majority of these involve defining a function named 'my_function' which, while does not require any arguments, has varying inner workings. Commonly, 'my_function' makes a call to another function, 'my_sum', and finally, regardless of any preceding tasks, returns the string "Hello". The purpose of 'my_function' is to perform operations of the 'my_sum' function and return a predefined string thus serves to trigger other functions and return a greeting message. However, as the specifics of 'my_sum' are not provided, the detailed functionality of these codes cannot be fully determined.
