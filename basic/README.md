<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'basic' library in Python appears to be a collection of functions mainly designed to return the greeting message "Hello". The key difference among these functions lies in whether they internally call another function named 'my_sum'. Some functions only output a fixed message, while others combine this with executing the 'my_sum' function. The specific operation performed by 'my_sum' isn't shared within the provided context, but it presumed to execute some tasks before the greeting is returned. The 'basic' library aims to provide functions with easy-to-understand interface, outputting greetings either standalone or combined with additional operations performed by local modules.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'basic' library in Python encapsulates a set of functions that mainly return a string "Hello". The functions inside this library do not typically require any arguments and their main task is to return a greeting message. There are variations where the functions within the 'basic' library can call other functions before returning the greeting message. These other functions are referred to as 'my_sum,' though their exact purpose or functionality is not specified. It is suspected that these functions perform certain operations required in the main function, possibly on global variables or other actions. The goal of this 'basic' library appears to offer an easy way to call a greeting message, possibly after performing a series of underlying operations via the additional 'my_sum' function.
