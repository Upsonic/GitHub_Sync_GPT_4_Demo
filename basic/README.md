<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'basic' library in this context is a hypothetical or conceptual library which consists of fundamental code structure and functionalities like a function defined without arguments and returning simple values. Mentioned as an element of this 'basic' library is 'same_place.my_function', which is a simple function in Python. The purpose of this function is to illustrate the return mechanism in Python functions, showcasing that a function can be designed to return a fixed string value every time it is invoked.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'basic' library provides fundamental elements that serve as building blocks for Python programming. The function 'my_function' from 'same_place' module in 'basic' library, for instance, is used to demonstrate the basic concept of a function returning a fixed value. The library thus aims to aid in understanding of basic Python concepts, making programming simpler and more efficient for beginners. Its elements help programmers to construct their code in a more organized and efficient manner, as they can re-use these basic functions instead of coding from scratch each time.
