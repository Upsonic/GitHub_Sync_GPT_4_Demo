<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'basic' library appears to be a collection of functions which primarily return a greeting in the form of the string "Hello". These functions vary in their internal complexity, with some simply returning the greeting immediately, while others first call another function 'my_sum()' before returning the greeting. The role and operations of 'my_sum()' are undefined in the summaries provided, making it hard to comprehend its specific purpose. Nonetheless, 'basic' library functions seem to be carrying out some operations (probably summation) via the 'my_sum()' function before returning a consistent output, the string "Hello".

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'basic' library contains a set of elements, mostly functions, configured to perform certain tasks or computations. As per the examples provided, 'my_function' appears to be the primary function in this library, having variations based on the location of other dependencies, such as the 'my_sum()' function. The overall aim of these functions seems to be carrying out an operation, possibly summing, and then returning a greeting text - "Hello". However, without more specific details or the definitions of the called functions like 'my_sum()', the exact usage cannot be determined.
