<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>As the given description lacks details on the 'basic.different_place' library, an accurate specific purpose can't be provided. However, based on the 'my_function' part, it can be inferred that this library might contain functions useful for different tasks. 'my_function' implies a generic function that may be used for anything depending on the user requirements. Under normal circumstances, libraries are a collection of modules, where each one of them is a file that consists of Python code, including variables, functions, classes, or other things. 'None' returned by the function suggests there's no value assigned yet, or the function may be used as a placeholder for future code. Further details would allow a more specific explanation.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>Without the actual context or code, it's challenging to specify the usage aim of the 'basic.different_place' library exactly. However, generally, a library in Python is a module or collection of modules that are grouped together. They contain pre-written pieces of code to perform common tasks, hence saving developers from writing the same code repetitively. In this context, 'basic.different_place' probably indicates a specific module within a library used for a certain application. 'my_function' appears to be a function within this module. But given that this function returns 'None', it's tough to determine its specific usage. The detailed functionality and usage would depend highly on what the library is designed to do and what specific task 'my_function' is coded to perform.
