```
<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'basic.different_place' library is likely a user-defined library coded in Python, which contains the function 'my_function'. The function 'my_function' in this library is specifically designed to execute a print statement displaying the string "Hello" in the console when called. The purpose of this library and its elements seems to be to store functions for output operations, which can be used in different locations of the code to streamline the process and increase the efficiency of the overall program.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'basic.different_place' seems to be a library module in Python, where the user has defined a function named 'my_function'. The purpose of this library would be to group together related codes, such as 'my_function', for easy management and usage. In specific, the 'my_function' is used to output the word "Hello", thereby being a simple utility for displaying this greeting. This library, hence, could possibly serve as a learning module to understand the basics of defining and using functions, or as a utility module in a larger application where you simply want to print out "Hello" at different places in the code.
