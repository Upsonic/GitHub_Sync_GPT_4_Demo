<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'basic.different_place_with_needed_local_module' library, as the name suggests, is used to manage and structure code that involves functions defined in a different location or module than the one where they are needed. One of the main components of this library, the 'my_function' function, showcases this by calling another function 'my_sum()' which is assumed to be defined in a different part of the program. This library likely facilitates effective code organization and reusability across different parts of a project by facilitating external module calls and managing dependencies.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'basic.different_place_with_needed_local_module' library seems to serve as a module for defining and organizing functions used in a larger program, specifically 'my_function' in this context. The function 'my_function' appears to play a role in executing another function 'my_sum()' and then producing the string output "Hello". The module likely abstracts the 'my_sum()' function and allows for a cleaner, more organized code structure. However, without more information about 'my_sum()', it is difficult to fully explain the library's usage aim.
