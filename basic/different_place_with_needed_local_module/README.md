<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>'basic.different_place_with_needed_local_module' appears to be a hypothetical custom library or module in Python, possibly detailing a set of functions and classes to perform specific tasks. Within this library or module, there's a function 'my_function' which uses a function 'my_sum'. 'my_function' does not take any arguments, it simply returns the string "Hello". The actual operations of 'my_function' depend largely on the 'my_sum' function which is not defined in this context. It suggests that the 'my_sum' function is either defined elsewhere in the module or is an imported function from another module. The specific-purpose or use-case of this library is not provided in the information given.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'basic.different_place_with_needed_local_module' library seems to be a Python library that contains the function 'my_function'. The main purpose of this library could be to provide tools or functions that are reusable across different parts of associated software. The mentioned function 'my_function' specifically seems to be a utility function that returns a greeting message, regardless of the results of the operation performed in 'my_sum' function which is being called within 'my_function'. The 'my_sum' function's definition and purpose are not given, which means it might be predefined in the same library or a different one. The use of this function suggests that 'basic.different_place_with_needed_local_module' could be part of bigger code base or module where local functions like 'my_sum' are used for performing specific tasks.
