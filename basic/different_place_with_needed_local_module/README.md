<br><b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Explanation:</b><br>The 'basic.different_place_with_needed_local_module' library seems to be a location where individual modules or functions are housed for the performance of specific tasks. One of the elements in this library is the 'my_function'. This function's role is to call another function named 'my_sum', perform operations, and then return a string "Hello". However, the specificity of those operations is not clear from this context. It's worth noting that results from the 'my_sum' function do not appear to be captured or used within 'my_function', suggesting that the primary output of 'my_function' is the string "Hello" regardless of the actions performed by 'my_sum'.

<b class="custom_code_highlight_green">Use Case:</b><br>The 'basic.different_place_with_needed_local_module' seems to be a code library containing various functions, of which 'my_function' is one example. The general aim or use of this library could vary widely based on the specific functions it contains, but considering the provided 'my_function', it may be used for executing certain operations, like invoking other functions, and then returning specific inputs. However, without more details or context to the other modules, it is challenging to specify the exact usage aim.

The element 'my_function' could be a part of a larger process where its string return ("Hello") plays a role, or perhaps the function is a template for training or educational purposes, demonstrating how to define a function, call another function within it, or return a result. The 'my_sum' function that 'my_function' calls implies that there may be mathematical or computational processes happening within this library as well. However, the exact usage would be clearer with more details or other function examples from the 'basic.different_place_with_needed_local_module' library.
